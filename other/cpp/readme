The code I wrote in c++. It depends on c++14 and uses a library called pugixml
(http://pugixml.org/) for the svg part.

Files in this directory:

Makefile for compiling.

main.cpp has the input/output.

graph.h + graph.cpp has the model of the graph and related functions, such as
the greedy algorithm.

graphGen.h + graphGen.cpp was an attempt to generate graphs, but it is
unfinished.

svg.h + svg.cpp has code to generate svg graphics.

layout.h + layout.cpp has some common functions for graphGen and svg, for
hexagonal grid.
